## ValleyGuard

website hosted on AWS Amplify (no longer active): [https://dev7432.d2ir80xfdjaxsq.amplifyapp.com/index.html](https://dev7432.d2ir80xfdjaxsq.amplifyapp.com/index.html)

communitymapp is the name of our repo for the ValleyGuard web application using AWS. 

# Description

The application uses AWS Location Services to display and output locations of reported incidents. Incidents can be filed on the FORM page of the website.

## Dependencies

We are using Serverless Lambda Functions via API Gateways to access and 
get/post data to a small DynamoDB database. The code for the AWS services 
can be found in the Lambda Functions folder.

All of our code is written in plain and native js, css, python, and html. Our project utilizes
Amazon Web Services such as Amplify, Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway.
